# Task list pattern - plugin for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit

This plugin is no longer maintained.

If you are using GOV.UK Frontend version 5.0.0 or above, you should use the [task list component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/task-list) from the GOV.UK Design System instead.

You can also use the task list template from the [common templates plugin](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit-common-templates/).

If you are using a previous version of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, you can continue to use this plugin until you upgrade.
